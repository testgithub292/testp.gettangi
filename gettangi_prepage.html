        <h5><b>A Straight Talking Statement to Prospective Investors</b></h5>
        <p> Before you consider investing in Tangi, please read this carefully.</p>
       <p>
        We want to be perfectly clear from the outset: <b>this project carries risk.</b> There are <b>no guarantees </b>of success, no promises of returns, and no illusions of safety. This website, by its very nature, is a promotional tool—it’s designed to highlight our vision, our product, and the immense potential of what we’re building. But <b>potential is not a guarantee,</b> and enthusiasm should never be mistaken for certainty. If you’re not prepared to possibly lose your investment, <b>do not invest.</b> It’s that simple.</p>
        <hr>
        <p><b>No Hype. No Hand-Holding.</b></p>
        <p>
          You can join us, but you must join us <b>on our terms,</b> not yours. <b>You are investing in our team’s vision, strategy, and potential. You are not employing us. You do not direct operations. You will not receive monthly financial statements.</b> We are a privately held company, and that does not change when the token becomes tradable on public exchanges.</p>
          <hr>
          <p><b>Use of Funds & Full Discretion</b></p>
          <p>
            Once invested, your funds will fuel the project. This includes—but is not limited to—marketing, infrastructure, software development, hardware, operations, staff salaries, compliance, expansion, and everything else that a legitimate business requires to succeed. <b> We reserve full discretion on how funds are spent.</b> We are not crowdsourcing opinions. We are building a business.
            We’d rather be brutally honest and lose 100 potential investors than sugar-coat reality and disappoint one. We're not here to convince you. We’re here to <b> inform you.</b> We’ve already attracted over 2,500 long-standing supporters who’ve stayed with us for years, turned down buybacks, and doubled down on their original investments after four years of waiting. If you're the type of investor who needs guarantees, control, or hand-holding—this is not the right opportunity for you. </p>
            <p><b>Compliance & Transparency</b></p>
            <p> From a compliance standpoint, you must know this:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>This is <b>not</b> a regulated security.</li>
                <li>You are <b>not</b> purchasing equity or debt.</li>
                <li>You are purchasing a <b>utility token </b>with functional use inside the Tangi ecosystem.</li>
                <li>The Tangi Token is <b>not guaranteed to appreciate in value.</b></li>
                <li>Your investment may become <b>illiquid</b>.</li>
                <li>We are not offering financial advice, and you should conduct your <b>own due diligence</b> and consult with a qualified advisor.</li>
                <li>We will <b>always</b> operate within the legal and regulatory frameworks required of us—and you are expected to do the same.</li>
              </ul>
              <hr>
              <p><b>Final Word</b></p>
              <p>
                We are here to build something meaningful. We welcome everyone—but we <b>don’t need </b>anyone. If you choose to come on this journey with us, we’ll treat your investment with respect and run this project with integrity. But we will not waste our time dealing with tyre-kickers, conspiracy theorists, or keyboard warriors. </p>
                
                <p>If you share our vision, understand the risks, and believe in what we’re building—we welcome you. And if you do decide to invest, do it <b>with eyes wide open and remember</b> to join our Telegram channel to connect with like-minded investors.
                 <b> Everything we've said here is on record. By ticking the box and entering our website, you agree we gave you every reason to walk away.</b></p>
            
                  <p><b>Risk Warning Statement</b></p>
                  <p>Applies to: All Users, Purchasers, and Platform Participants</p>
                  <p><b>Important Notice – Read Carefully Before Engaging</b></p>
                  <p>By accessing, purchasing from, or participating in any product, program, token sale, platform service, or offering associated with GetTangiNow Corporation (hereafter "Tangi", "we", "our", "us") or its global subsidiaries, you confirm that you have read, understood, and accepted the following risk disclosures.</p>
                  <p>Tangi products and services are not financial securities. They are not investments, and Tangi is not a regulated financial entity or broker. Our tokens, programs, or platform services do not constitute shares, equities, debt instruments, or any form of ownership in the company, nor do they carry voting rights, profit entitlements, or guarantees of return. The value of any tokens, rewards, or services provided is speculative, may fluctuate, and may become entirely worthless.</p>
                  <p><b>Key Disclosures & Risks</b></p>
                  <p>Not Regulated / No Investor Protection</p>
                  <p>Tangi does not operate under the oversight of any securities or financial regulatory body, including but not limited to the SEC (USA), FCA (UK), ASIC (Australia), or ESMA (EU). As such:</p>
                  <p>There are no investor protections, compensation schemes, or recourse mechanisms available to you.
                    Purchasing our tokens or services is at your own risk and may result in the total loss of your funds.</p>
                    <p>If you are not prepared to lose all the money you spend with us, you should not participate.</p>
                    <p><b>High Risk of Total Loss</b></p>
                    <p>Most early-stage and blockchain-based projects fail. You are more likely to lose your funds than to profit. Market conditions, regulatory changes, technical setbacks, or strategic pivots may result in:</p>
                    <p>Devaluation of tokens or services
                      Project suspension, modification, or closure
                      Abandonment of products or platform features
                      We make no promises or guarantees regarding project success, profitability, or continuity.</p>
                      <p><b>Illiquidity & Lack of Exit Options</b></p>
                      <p>Our tokens or credits may not be easily exchanged for fiat or other currencies. Secondary market liquidity may be unavailable, and if available, may be volatile, shallow, or manipulated by third parties. You may be unable to sell, transfer, or redeem your holdings at any time, or ever.</p>
                      <p>No Rights, No Dividends, No Equity</p>
                      <p>Participation does not entitle you to dividends, income, profit-sharing, or ownership. Our tokens are utility-based access tools, not investment products. They do not represent a legal claim against the company or its assets.</p>
                      <p><b>No Guarantees of Price or Value</b></p>
                      <p>The market price of any tokens we distribute or accept is determined solely by market forces and has no fixed or intrinsic value. We offer no assurances on price support, floor values, or appreciation.
                      </p>
                      <p><b>Vesting, Lockups & Limitations</b></p>
                      <p>Tangi may impose vesting schedules, staking lockups, or usage restrictions on token allocations to support the health of the ecosystem. These limitations may affect your ability to sell or use tokens, regardless of market price.
                      </p>
                      <p><b>No Fiduciary or Advisory Role</b></p>
                      <p>We do not act as financial advisors, brokers, or fiduciaries. You should obtain independent professional advice before participating. Any materials shared are for informational purposes only and do not constitute investment advice, solicitation, or endorsement.</p>
                      <p><b>Compliance, Legal, and Taxation</b></p>
                      <p>You are solely responsible for:</p>
                      <p>Determining your eligibility to participate under local laws
                        Declaring any gains or losses for tax purposes
                        Complying with your country’s financial regulations
                        Participation may be illegal in your jurisdiction. You agree that you are participating lawfully and at your own risk.</p>
                        <p><b>Technology & Operational Risks</b></p>
                        <p><b>Blockchain platforms are subject to:</b></p>
                        <p>Hacks, bugs, smart contract failures
                          Network congestion, outages, or protocol changes
                          Wallet mismanagement or private key loss (by you)
                          We are not liable for technical failures, wallet losses, or smart contract malfunctions.</p>
                          <p><b>Final Warning</b></p>
                          <p>If you are unsure about any aspect of this project, if you require the protection of regulated investment schemes, or if you are not capable of absorbing risk which may or may not lead to the partial or total loss of your funds, you should not participate.</p>
                          <p>By continuing, you waive all legal claims against GetTangiNow Corporation, its directors, partners, team members, and service providers.</p>

                  <br>
                  <p class="animate-bottom">Tangi provides compliant, bank-integrated payment processing for highly regulated industries where traditional providers refuse to operate.
                  </p>
                  <p class="animate-bottom">Our flagship solution focuses on the legal cannabis market — a $30B+ U.S. industry with over 8,000 retailers and 60 million consumers that still rely heavily on cash due to regulatory limitations and banking restrictions.</p>
                  <p class="animate-bottom">At the heart of our system is Tangi Token (TNG) — a real utility token used to facilitate payments across the retail cannabis ecosystem.</p>
                  <p class="animate-bottom">With traditional banking partners unwilling to serve this sector, we've solved the single greatest challenge: we secured an exclusive partnership with a U.S.-regulated, pro-crypto bank.</p>
                  <p class="animate-bottom">This gives us — and only us — the ability to offer cannabis retailers a legal, transparent, fully compliant payment platform with traditional card payments, mobile payments, and a pathway to crypto-token adoption.</p>

                  <br>
                  <p class="animate-bottom">Tangi Token isn’t a speculative meme coin waiting to find its use. It’s already at the core of a functioning, real-world solution with mass utility potential.</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li class="animate-bottom"><b>Retailers</b> save on transaction fees and gain access to digital payments for the first time.</li>
                    <li class="animate-bottom"><b>Consumers</b> get discounts, loyalty rewards, and more reasons to return.</li>
                    <li class="animate-bottom"><b>You</b>, the token holder, can sell your tokens on the public exchange — not to other speculators, but to end users who actually need them to transact. <b>Tangi gives you an actual buyer.</b></li>

                  <p class="animate-bottom">For a limited time, tokens are available at $0.80 as part of our final presale before going public.</p>

                  <p class="animate-bottom">Unlike typical crypto projects that chase speculators, Tangi will attract real users. As we scale retail adoption and convert consumers to token payments, the demand base will grow organically.</p>
                  <!--p class="animate-bottom">Our projections show that with even 1% of the U.S. cannabis market captured, the token could reach $6.60 based on transactional volume and velocity. Of course, that figure is hypothetical and not guaranteed — future performance will depend on market factors and business execution.</p-->

It’s a powerful sign of long-term belief in the team, the technology, and the opportunity ahead. With limited supply, high token lockup, and an end-user–driven model, price stability is built into our ecosystem by design. They’ve chosen to stay the course because they see what’s coming. This is the strongest signal of trust in the team that Round 1 holders could possibly demonstrate.</p>

              <p>When the token lists, it will be on the way to having a built-in user base of 8000 retailers and 60 million end users, all of whom have a valuable use for the token. That’s the real value—and that’s where the money is. When you invest in Tangi, you’re investing in a token with a clear path to growth, driven by utility and compliance. </p>
              <p>As a Round 2 investor, you're stepping into a unique and strategically timed phase of Tangi’s growth. Unlike early investors who backed the concept, you’re investing at a moment when everything is coming to life—our market entry, our token rollout, and our public listing are all converging to create a robust investment opportunity.</p>

              <p>There is a maximum supply of 250m tokens. The circulating supply will be limited to the 50 million tokens held by you and your fellow investors from the presale. The demand will be driven by a $33 billion market in transaction volume. Run the numbers yourself. </p>
              <p>Whether you take 1%, 2%, or 100% of that $33B market and apply 50 million tokens to that number, the math will speak for itself. The more market share we capture, the greater the token value. When we list the token, you can choose to sell to the next wave of investors looking to jump on our bandwagon, or you can hold and wait to sell directly to end users of our utility token.</p>

                Unless you’re deeply involved in the cannabis retail industry, you probably don’t realize that banking is the single biggest roadblock for payment providers in this sector. It’s the final hurdle—the missing piece—that has kept payment providers from truly breaking into this space.
                Without a bank, nothing else matters. No compliance, no legitimacy, no sustainable business.</p>
                <p>That’s why every payment provider before us has either failed or operated illegally.
                  We’ve done what no one else could. We secured the banking partnership the entire industry has been chasing. This isn’t just a win—it’s the foundation that makes everything you’re about to read possible. And with it, we’re positioned to take over.</p>

              <h3 style="color: #5737c4;">The Reason You Should Invest—Or The Reason You Can’t Afford Not To</h3>
              <br>
              <p>If you’re looking for a reason to invest, you’ve just read it. If you’re looking for a reason not to, you won’t find one—because no other payment provider in the cannabis industry has what we have.
                This isn’t speculation, hype, or a gamble. This is the single most important factor determining success in this space.</p>
                <p>Every failed payment provider before us lacked a compliant banking solution. Every future competitor will face the same roadblock.
                  We’ve already crossed that hurdle. That’s why we’re positioned to dominate. The only question left is—are you going to be part of it?</p>
