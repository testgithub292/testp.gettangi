        <h3>Executive Summary </h3>
        <br>
        <p>GetTangiNow Corporation, operating as Tangi, introduces the first fully compliant, bank-backed 
            payment ecosystem tailored for the $33 billion U.S. legal cannabis industry. Addressing the 
            sector’s reliance on cash-only transactions due to federal banking restrictions, Tangi integrates 
            traditional digital payments with blockchain-based solutions, delivering a revolutionary platform 
            for merchants and consumers.</p>
            <p>At the core of the ecosystem is the Tangi Token ($TNG), a BEP-20 utility token built on Binance 
                Smart Chain, enabling fast, secure, and transparent payments. Tangi’s infrastructure includes: </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Tangi App:</b> A consumer wallet for managing tokens, tracking rewards, and making 
                    payments. </li>
                <li><b>Tangi Pay POS:</b> A merchant point-of-sale system for cashless transactions and loyalty 
                    programs. </li>
                <li><b>Tangi Loyalty Engine:</b> A rewards system incentivizing adoption among retailers, 
                    consumers, and partners.</li>
                <li><b>Auto-Replenishment System: </b> Ensures sustained token demand through automatic wallet 
                    top-ups. </li>
                <li><b>Tangi Exchange Integration:</b> Transitions token purchases to public exchanges post
                    listing, with early investors controlling 100% of the initial 50 million token supply. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Tangi has achieved a historic milestone by launching the first compliant, bank-backed digital 
                payment solution for cannabis, supporting debit card processing, bank-to-bank transfers, and 
                token-based payments. The Company is now pioneering compliant <b>credit card processing,</b> a first 
                in the industry, further enhancing merchant convenience and consumer accessibility. </p>
                <p>Targeting over 8,000 U.S. dispensaries and 60 million consumers, Tangi addresses critical industry challenges: lack of banking access, high fees, and operational inefficiencies. The platform drives merchant revenue through lower transaction costs and loyalty incentives, while offering consumers modern payment options and rewards. Tangi’s phased deployment begins in high-volume U.S. markets, with plans for global expansion into legal cannabis regions.</p>
                <p>The <b>Tangi Token</b> will list publicly in Q4 2025 on major exchanges, with a $1.50 starting price and a $1.5 million liquidity pool locked for 12 months. With a total supply of 250 million tokens and an initial circulating supply of 50 million, early investors are positioned to benefit from real-world demand driven by a $33 billion market need. Tangi is not a speculative cryptocurrency but a compliant, scalable solution, poised to redefine cannabis commerce.</p>

            <h3>Market Opportunity</h3>
            <br>
            <p>The U.S. legal cannabis industry, generating over $33 billion annually, is undergoing rapid transformation as legalization expands across 38 states for medical use and 24 states plus the District of Columbia for recreational use. Driven by increasing consumer demand, policy shifts, and new market entrants like New York and New Jersey. California alone accounts for over $10 billion in sales, making it the world’s largest legal cannabis market.</p>
            <p>Despite this growth, the industry faces significant operational and financial challenges due to federal restrictions classifying cannabis as a Schedule I substance:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>	<b>Limited Banking Access:</b> Most financial institutions avoid serving cannabis businesses due to federal penalties, forcing over 8,000 licensed dispensaries to operate primarily in cash. This increases risks of theft, fraud, and operational inefficiencies.</li>
                <li>	<b>High Banking Fees:</b> Dispensaries with banking access face exorbitant fees, ranging from $750 to $2,500 per month, straining profitability.</li>
                <li>	<b>Cash-Only Transactions:</b> Approximately 80% of cannabis transactions are cash-based, complicating payroll, tax payments, and customer convenience.</li>
                <li>	<b>Competitive Pressure:</b> Rising competition among dispensaries heightens the need for customer acquisition and retention strategies, with loyalty programs becoming critical.</li>
                <li>	<b>E-Commerce and Payment Technology:</b> Growing consumer preference for online shopping and mobile payments demands modern, compliant payment solutions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>With over 8,000 dispensaries and an estimated 60 million consumers, the cannabis industry represents a significant opportunity for innovative financial solutions. Tangi is uniquely positioned to address these challenges by offering a compliant, bank-backed payment ecosystem that replaces cash transactions, reduces fees, and enhances customer engagement. The platform targets a fragmented market of standalone dispensaries and emerging national brands, capitalizing on the industry’s consolidation and the urgent need for scalable, cashless payment infrastructure.</p>

              <br>
              <h3>Competitive Advantage</h3>
              <br>
              <p>GetTangiNow Corporation (“Tangi”) distinguishes itself as the leading payment solution for the U.S. legal cannabis industry through its pioneering, compliant, and bank-backed ecosystem. Unlike other providers that have struggled with regulatory barriers or relied on unstable workarounds, Tangi has achieved unprecedented milestones, positioning it years ahead of competitors. The following factors underscore Tangi’s competitive edge in addressing the $33 billion cannabis market’s payment challenges.</p>
            </div>
              <br>
              <div id="bgcolorpage">
              <h3>5.1 First-Mover Advantage in Compliant Payments</h3>
              <br>
              <p>Tangi is the first company to successfully develop and launch a fully compliant, bank-backed digital payment solution for the cannabis industry, a feat no other provider has accomplished. While countless solutions have been proposed, most relied on non-compliant methods, such as masked debit transactions or digital wallets, which were unsustainable and frequently shut down. Tangi’s operational platform already supports:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>	Compliant debit card processing.</li>
                <li>	Secure bank-to-bank transfers.</li>
                <li>	Blockchain-based token payments via the Tangi Token ($TNG).</li>
              </ul>
              <p>This established infrastructure, proven through a 9-month pilot processing $24 million in transactions with a major retail player, sets Tangi apart as the industry’s only provider of a legally sound payment system.</p>
              <br>
              <h3>5.2 Pioneering Compliant Credit Card Processing</h3>
              <br>
              <p>Tangi is poised to achieve another industry first: compliant credit card processing for cannabis transactions, a capability no competitor has successfully implemented. Major players and startups alike have avoided this complex challenge due to regulatory hurdles. Through its visionary banking partnership and relentless commitment to compliance, Tangi is finalizing a framework to enable credit card payments within its ecosystem. This development:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>	Complements existing services (debit, ACH, token payments).</li>
                <li>	Enhances merchant convenience and consumer accessibility.</li>
                <li>	Establishes a new gold standard for cannabis payment processing.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>By offering a multi-channel payment solution, Tangi addresses a critical gap that competitors have not dared to tackle, further solidifying its leadership.</p>
              <br>
              <h3>5.3 Exclusive Banking Partnership</h3>
              <br>
              <p>Tangi’s strategic partnership with a compliant U.S. bank provides a foundation of regulatory stability and operational reliability that competitors lack. While other providers face constant threats of shutdown due to non-compliance, Tangi’s banking relationship ensures:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>	Legal and transparent transaction processing.</li>
                <li>	Integration with traditional financial networks via the Tangi Gateway.</li>
                <li>	Scalability to support credit card processing and future innovations.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>This exclusive partnership, secured after years of development, is a barrier to entry for competitors struggling to navigate the cannabis industry’s federal restrictions.</p>
              <br>
              <h3>5.4 Dual Payment System</h3>
              <br>
              <p>Unlike competitors limited to either traditional or cryptocurrency-based solutions, Tangi offers a dual payment system that seamlessly integrates:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>	<b>Traditional Payments:</b> Debit card processing, ACH transfers, and forthcoming credit card processing, catering to consumers’ preference for familiar payment methods.</li>
                <li>	<b>Blockchain-Based Payments:</b> The Tangi Token ($TNG), a BEP-20 utility token on Binance Smart Chain, enabling fast, secure, and low-cost transactions.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>This hybrid approach provides unmatched flexibility, appealing to both merchants seeking cost savings and consumers demanding modern payment options. Competitors’ reliance on single-channel solutions (e.g., cash or non-compliant crypto) cannot match Tangi’s versatility.</p>
              <br>
              <h3>5.5 Proven Real-World Success</h3>
              <br>
              <p>Tangi’s solution has been tested and validated in real-world conditions, processing $24 million in transactions over nine months in collaboration with one of the industry’s largest retail players. Although the partnership ended due to differing visions, the pilot demonstrated Tangi’s ability to:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>	Handle high transaction volumes.</li>
                <li>	Maintain compliance and security.</li>
                <li>	Deliver value to merchants and consumers.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>This track record contrasts with competitors whose non-compliant solutions failed, such as the retail partner that went out of business due to inability to meet regulatory standards. Tangi’s success strengthens its credibility and market position.</p>
              <br>
              <h3>5.6 Comprehensive Ecosystem Driving Adoption</h3>
              <br>
              <p>Tangi’s ecosystem extends beyond payments to include tools that enhance merchant profitability and consumer loyalty, setting it apart from competitors focused solely on transactions. Key components include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><b>Tangi Loyalty Engine:</b>	 Rewards consumers, merchants, and partners for token usage, driving adoption and retention.</li>

              </ul>
              <p>These features create a self-reinforcing cycle of adoption, unmatched by competitors’ fragmented or transaction-only offerings.</p>
              <br>
              <h3>5.7 Scalable and Secure Technology</h3>
              <br>
              <p>Built on the Binance Smart Chain, Tangi’s platform leverages advanced distributed ledger technology for high-speed, secure, and decentralized transactions. Unlike competitors vulnerable to centralized system failures, Tangi ensures:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>	<b>Security:</b> Level 1 PCI compliance, SHA-256 SSL encryption, and KYC verification.</li>
                <li>	<b>Scalability: </b> Supports a growing user base of 8,000 dispensaries and 60 million consumers.</li>

              <br>
              <h3>5.8 Strategic Market Positioning</h3>
              <br>
              <p>Tangi’s phased deployment strategy targets high-volume U.S. cannabis markets before expanding globally, leveraging its compliance and banking partnership to navigate regulatory landscapes. Competitors, constrained by regulatory risks or lack of banking support, cannot match Tangi’s ability to scale rapidly and compliantly. The planned Q4 2025 public token listing further enhances Tangi’s market presence, offering liquidity and investor opportunities that competitors cannot provide.</p>
              <br>
              <h3>5.9 Overcoming Industry Mistrust</h3>
              <br>
              <p>The cannabis industry’s history of failed payment solutions has bred skepticism among retailers. Tangi’s approach, offering free listings on its Cannabis Superstore, building trust through transparent services, and transitioning merchants to token-based payments, differentiates it from competitors’ hard-sell tactics. This organic, trust-based strategy ensures sustainable adoption, positioning Tangi as a reliable partner in a market wary of unreliable providers.</p>
              <br>
              <h3>Tokenomics and Listing Strategy</h3>
              <br>
              <p>The Tangi Token ($TNG) is the cornerstone of the Tangi Ecosystem, designed to facilitate secure, efficient, and compliant payments within the $33 billion U.S. legal cannabis industry. Built on the Binance Smart Chain as a BEP-20 utility token, $TNG drives transactions, rewards, and ecosystem access, creating real-world demand through its integration into a bank-backed payment platform. This section outlines the token’s economic structure, distribution, demand drivers, and public listing strategy, emphasizing its role as a scarce, utility-driven asset with significant growth potential for early investors.</p>

              <br>
              <p>Tangi’s platform is designed to operate within the legal boundaries of the U.S. financial system, despite the federal classification of cannabis as a Schedule I substance. Key compliance measures include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>	<b>Exclusive Banking Partnership:</b> Tangi has secured a strategic partnership with a compliant U.S. bank, enabling the first fully compliant digital payment solution for the cannabis industry.

The bank’s commitment to work exclusively with Tangi provides a foundation of regulatory stability, distinguishing it from competitors reliant on non-compliant workarounds.</li>
                <li>	<b>Integration with Traditional Financial Networks:</b> Through the Tangi Gateway, the platform facilitates seamless fund transfers between Tangi accounts and personal bank accounts, ensuring compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) and financial oversight requirements. Transactions are processed transparently, avoiding the risks associated with unregulated payment methods.</li>
                <li>	<b>Response to Federal Restrictions:</b> While the Secure and Fair Enforcement (SAFE) Banking Act, which would protect banks serving cannabis businesses, remains unenacted as of March 2025, Tangi’s banking partnership mitigates this challenge by operating within existing legal frameworks.

              <p><b>Significance:</b> Tangi’s compliant banking integration enables legal transaction processing, positioning it as the only provider capable of delivering a scalable, bank-backed payment solution in the cannabis industry.</p>

              <h3>11.1 Risk Factors</h3>
              <br>
              <h4>11.1.1 High Risk of Total Loss</h4>
              <br>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  	<b>Risk:</b> Participation in Tangi’s ecosystem, including purchasing $TNG or using platform services, carries a high risk of total financial loss. Most early-stage and blockchain-based projects fail, and market conditions, regulatory changes, technical setbacks, or strategic pivots may result in:
                    <ul>
                      <li>	Devaluation of $TNG or platform services.</li>
                      <li>	Project suspension, modification, or closure.</li>
                      <li>	Abandonment of products or platform features.</li>

                </li>
                <li>	<b>Details:</b> The whitepaper emphasizes that $TNG is not an investment, security, or equity, and its value is speculative, potentially becoming entirely worthless. Tangi makes no promises or guarantees regarding project success, profitability, or continuity.</li>
                <li>	<b>Significance:</b> Stakeholders must be prepared to lose all funds committed to Tangi, as no assurances of returns are provided.</li>
              </ul>
              <br>
              <h4>11.1.2 Lack of Regulatory Oversight and Investor Protection</h4>
              <br>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  	<b>Risk:</b> Tangi operates without oversight from securities or financial regulatory bodies, such as the SEC (USA), FCA (UK), ASIC (Australia), or ESMA (EU). As a result:
                    <ul>
                      <li>	No investor protections, compensation schemes, or recourse mechanisms are available.</li>
                      <li>	Participation is at the user’s own risk, with potential for total loss.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>	<b>Details:</b> $TNG and Tangi’s services are not classified as financial securities, shares, equities, or debt instruments, and do not confer ownership, voting rights, dividends, or profit entitlements. The lack of regulatory oversight increases exposure to market and operational risks.</li>
                <li>	<b>Significance:</b> Stakeholders requiring regulated investment protections should not participate, as Tangi’s unregulated status heightens financial risk.</li>
              </ul>
              <br>
              <h4>11.1.3 Regulatory and Legal Risks</h4>
              <br>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  	<b>Risk:</b> The evolving legal landscape for cannabis and cryptocurrency may impact Tangi’s operations and $TNG’s value. Key risks include:
                    <ul>
                      <li>	Federal prohibition of cannabis as a Schedule I substance, limiting banking access and exposing businesses to penalties.</li>
                      <li>	Potential changes in state or federal regulations that could restrict Tangi’s ability to operate or affect token utility.</li>
                      <li>	Jurisdictional restrictions that may deem participation illegal for some users.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>	<b>Details:</b> Despite legalization in 38 states for medical use and 24 for recreational use, federal restrictions create uncertainty. The Secure and Fair Enforcement (SAFE) Banking Act, which would protect banks serving cannabis businesses, remains unenacted as of March 2025. Participants are solely responsible for ensuring compliance with local laws and tax obligations.</li>
                <li>	<b>Significance:</b> Regulatory changes could disrupt Tangi’s business model, requiring stakeholders to accept this uncertainty.</li>
              </ul>
              <br>
              <h4>11.1.4 Illiquidity and Lack of Exit Options</h4>
              <br>
              <ul>
                <li>	<b>Risk:</b> $TNG may not be easily exchanged for fiat or other currencies, and secondary market liquidity may be unavailable, volatile, or subject to manipulation by third parties. Stakeholders may be unable to sell, transfer, or redeem tokens at any time, or ever.</li>
                <li>	<b>Details:</b> The whitepaper notes that tokens may face vesting schedules, staking lockups, or usage restrictions, limiting their transferability. No assurances are provided for price support, floor values, or appreciation.</li>
                <li>	<b>Significance:</b> Investors and users face the risk of holding illiquid assets, potentially unable to realize value from their participation.</li>
              </ul>
              <br>
              <h4>11.1.5 Technology and Operational Risks</h4>

                    <ul>
                      <li>	Hacks, bugs, or smart contract failures.</li>
                      <li>	Network congestion, outages, or protocol changes on the Binance Smart Chain.</li>
                      <li>	Wallet mismanagement or private key loss by users.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>	<b>Details:</b> Tangi is not liable for technical failures, wallet losses, or smart contract malfunctions. The platform’s reliance on blockchain technology introduces vulnerabilities inherent to decentralized systems.</li>
                <li>	<b>Significance:</b> Technical disruptions could impair platform functionality or result in financial losses for users.</li>
              </ul>

              <ul>
                <li>

                    <ul>
                      <li>	Intense competition among 8,000+ dispensaries may hinder retailer adoption of Tangi’s platform.</li>
                      <li>	Mistrust from past failed payment solutions could slow merchant onboarding.</li>
                      <li>	Market conditions, such as consumer preferences or economic shifts, may affect demand for $TNG.</li>

                </li>
                <li>	<b>Details:</b> The whitepaper highlights the industry’s fragmentation and the challenge of convincing skeptical retailers to adopt a new payment system after repeated failures by competitors.</li>
                <li>	<b>Significance:</b> Failure to achieve widespread adoption could limit $TNG’s utility and value, impacting stakeholders.</li>
              </ul>
              <br>
              <h4>11.1.7 Project Timeline and Execution Risks</h4>
              <br>
              <ul>
                <li>	<b>Risk:</b> Tangi does not adhere to rigid timelines, prioritizing quality over arbitrary deadlines. Delays in platform deployment, public listing (Q4 2025), or feature rollouts (e.g., credit card processing, NFC payments) could affect stakeholder expectations.</li>
                <li>	<b>Details:</b> The whitepaper emphasizes flexibility in deliverables, noting that Tangi will not rush decisions that could jeopardize success. This approach may frustrate stakeholders seeking short-term results.</li>
                <li>	<b>Significance:</b> Stakeholders must accept potential delays, as Tangi focuses on sustainable execution rather than meeting fixed schedules.</li>
              </ul>
              <br>
              <h4>11.1.8 No Fiduciary or Advisory Role</h4>

              <ul>
                <li>	<b>Risk:</b> Tangi does not act as a financial advisor, broker, or fiduciary, and its materials are for informational purposes only, not constituting investment advice or solicitation.</li>
                <li>	<b>Details:</b> Stakeholders are responsible for obtaining independent professional advice and conducting due diligence before participating. Tangi’s unregulated status means it offers no fiduciary protections.</li>
                <li>	<b>Significance:</b> Lack of advisory support increases the burden on stakeholders to assess risks independently, heightening potential for uninformed decisions.</li>

              <br>
              <ul>
                <li>	<b>Trust-Based Strategy:</b> Tangi’s market entry approach, starting with free listings on the Tangi Cannabis Superstore, builds retailer trust by delivering value without hard-sell tactics. This addresses skepticism from past failed solutions.</li>

              <h3>Conclusion and Call to Action</h3>
              <br>

Tangi stands alone as the only provider to solve the cannabis industry’s payment challenges, positioning it for significant market leadership as the industry grows to a projected $75 billion by 2025.</p>
              <p>The Tangi Ecosystem combines cutting-edge technology with practical utility, offering a suite of tools and programs tailored for 8,000 dispensaries and 60 million consumers:</p>
              <ul>

              <p>The Tangi Token ($TNG) is central to this ecosystem, driving real-world demand through its role in payments, rewards, and ecosystem access. With a total supply of 250 million tokens and an initial circulating supply of 50 million controlled entirely by Round 1 and Round 2 investors, $TNG offers a scarce, utility-driven asset poised for value appreciation. The planned Q4 2025 public listing on multiple exchanges, with a $1.50 starting price and a $1.5 million liquidity pool locked for 12 months, ensures accessibility and market stability. Unlike speculative cryptocurrencies, $TNG’s value is rooted in necessity, fueled by the transaction needs of a $33 billion market and supported by an auto-replenishment system that sustains demand.</p>
              <p>Tangi is more than a token, it is the infrastructure for a new era of cannabis retail. Its business model, generating revenue through transaction fees, credit interest, exchange fees, and supplier commissions, ensures scalability and sustainability. The phased deployment strategy, starting with free listings on the Tangi Cannabis Superstore and expanding to physical stores and global markets, leverages a trust-based approach to overcome industry skepticism and drive organic adoption. This is not a speculative venture but a real-world solution, built on five years of development, a compliant banking partnership, and a commitment to integrity and transparency.</p>
