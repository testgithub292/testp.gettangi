                    <p>The cannabis industry presents an enormous opportunity to tap into a $33 billion market in transaction volume, and Tangi is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this with our innovative payment solution. With every transaction we process, whether it’s through traditional payments or our more rewarding token-based system, we generate revenue through transaction fees. This gives us a direct line to a massive market that is already in place.</p>
                    <p>The beauty of our business model lies in its simplicity and the real, immediate need it addresses. Retailers and consumers in the cannabis industry have been stuck with a limited, inefficient payment infrastructure that forces them to rely on cash-only transactions. Not only is this cumbersome and outdated, but it also introduces significant risks and challenges. Retailers are burdened with managing large amounts of cash, while consumers are forced to carry cash with them to make purchases. This, in turn, increases both security and operational risks for retailers.</p>
                    <p>As we enter a digital-first world, the need for compliant, reliable, and seamless payment solutions is undeniable.</p>

            <p>But it doesn’t stop there—the token-based payments we offer are not just another payment method, they are a solution that generates value for everyone involved. With every token transaction, we not only provide consumers with exclusive rewards and discounts, but we also help retailers save significantly on transaction fees—ultimately reducing costs and increasing profits. We can offer them cheaper transaction fees, and yet, we still make higher margins compared to traditional payment methods.</p>
           
            <div class="hidden-content-investor-gain" id="hiddenContent-investor-gain-1">
             <p><b>For the investor, the real power lies in the sheer volume of transactions already happening in this $33 billion industry</b>. Every single transaction that happens on our system generates revenue. We are capitalizing on the existing sales and providing an infrastructure that seamlessly shifts this entire market away from cash reliance and into a digital payment system. As more retailers adopt our payment solution, and as more consumers use the token to unlock its rewards, the volume of transactions will only continue to grow.</p>
            <p>The retailer and consumer both have an essential need for our service. Retailers need a solution that allows them to accept payments in a way that’s compliant, efficient, and scalable, while consumers want a seamless, easy, and secure way to make purchases without the hassle of carrying cash. Tangi offers that, and it’s a solution that makes life easier for all parties involved.</p>
            <p>We’re already operating in a market that is generating billions in transactions, and we’re positioned to capture a significant share of that volume by offering a payment solution that is both needed and desired. This is how we generate revenue—through transaction fees on a massive, existing market that is desperate for a better way to handle payments. </p>
            <p>In short, the need for digital payment solutions in cannabis is undeniable, and Tangi is in the perfect position to meet that need. By capitalizing on the existing sales volume and providing a compliant, cost-effective, and user-friendly solution, we’re ensuring that both retailers and consumers adopt our payment solution—creating a self-sustaining cycle of growth that directly benefits everyone involved.</p>

            <h3 style="font-weight: bold; color: #5737c4;">How Investors Benefit from Consumers Token Use</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Cannabis consumers are a unique breed—they are savvy shoppers who love a good deal and always seek out discounts, rewards, and the best possible quality for the lowest price. This isn't just a stereotype; it's a behavior that's widely recognized within the industry. These consumers are always on the lookout for ways to get more value out of their purchases, and they're quick to join loyalty programs that offer perks like rewards, exclusive discounts, and other benefits.</p>
            <p>What makes cannabis consumers stand out from any other type of shopper is their willingness to engage with programs that reward them for spending, yet they have been largely excluded from such programs due to the nature of the industry. Because cannabis transactions are often cash-based, it's nearly impossible to track their purchasing habits. That means they’ve been shut out from participating in the kind of rewards programs that virtually every other industry has adopted and perfected over the years.</p>
            <div class="hidden-content-investor-gain" id="hiddenContent-investor-gain-2">
            <p>That’s where <b>Tangi</b> comes in, and why our model is perfectly tailored to meet the needs of cannabis consumers. The fact that the token payment option is tied directly to rewards, discounts, and exclusive benefits creates an irresistible value proposition for cannabis shoppers. They’ve been crying out for a way to enjoy the same benefits they get from other consumer sectors—and we’re here to provide that. Tangi allows cannabis consumers to access a rewards system that is otherwise unavailable to them due to the cash-based nature of their industry.</p>
            <p>But it’s not just about meeting their needs—it's about tapping into one of the largest underserved consumer groups in the world. With 60 million legal cannabis consumers in the U.S. alone, it’s crazy that no one has yet delivered a seamless way to engage them with loyalty programs. Tangi’s token, with its rewards and incentive structure, guarantees adoption because it directly aligns with what cannabis consumers already want: value, rewards, and discounts for the products they’re already buying.</p>
            <p>For us, it's music to our ears. Not only are we providing a long-awaited solution to a massive gap in the cannabis market, but we’re ensuring the adoption of our token by offering a solution that directly addresses the unique behaviors and desires of cannabis consumers. The simplicity of our model—offering rewards through token payments—gives cannabis consumers what they’ve been waiting for, creating immediate demand and ensuring that the transition to token payments is effortless.</p>
            <p>In short, Tangi doesn't just give cannabis consumers what they want—it provides what they need. And in doing so, it gives us the perfect vehicle to drive token adoption, increasing value for both the consumers and investors alike.</p>
            <p>This strategy not only meets the needs of cannabis consumers but also plays directly into the hands of our investors. By creating a rewards-driven ecosystem that attracts and engages a massive, underserved consumer base, we’re ensuring rapid adoption of the Tangi token—and mass adoption is the key to driving its value. As more consumers switch to using the token for its rewards, discounts, and loyalty benefits, the demand for tokens will increase, directly benefiting the token’s market value. For investors, this means that by getting in early, you're positioning yourself to capitalize on a growing market with significant demand, not only from the consumers but from the retailers who will be incentivized to use our compliant payment system. The win-win for both consumers and retailers accelerates token adoption, creating a clear path for increased demand and, consequently, higher token value—making this a highly lucrative opportunity for our investors.</p>

        <span id="toggleText2" style="font-size: 18px;">That’s where <b>Tangi</b> comes in, and why our model is...</span><a class="modern-link toggleButton2"  onclick="toggleText2()" id="toggleBtn-investor-gain-2">Show More</a>

            <h3 style="font-weight: bold; color: #5737c4;">How Investors Gain from Retailers Token Use</h3>
            <br>
            <p>For cannabis retailers, the benefits of adopting Tangi’s payment system are undeniable. First and foremost, the token offers significantly cheaper transaction fees compared to traditional payment methods, saving retailers thousands of dollars annually. Unlike traditional methods where fees can be as high as 11%, the token system charges a much lower fee, meaning higher profit margins for retailers. This alone makes the transition to token payments an obvious choice.</p>
            <p>In addition to the cost savings, our banking relationship ensures that retailers gain access to a fully compliant and transparent payment system, something that’s been sorely lacking in the cannabis industry. </p>
            <div class="hidden-content-investor-gain" id="hiddenContent-investor-gain-3">
             <p>  This not only gives them peace of mind but also protects them from the risks of operating in a cash-based system, which can often lead to issues like theft, compliance concerns, and logistical nightmares. The ability to accept payments legally and compliantly is a game-changer.</p>
            <p><b>Our rewards program</b> is another key benefit. By offering consumers incentives, discounts, and loyalty rewards for using the token, retailers create a more engaged and loyal customer base, which drives repeat business and boosts sales. Consumers who are incentivized to use the token will naturally become more committed to shopping with those retailers, knowing they can earn rewards while shopping for cannabis—something that’s difficult to offer in a cash-only environment.</p>
            <p>For retailers, this is a full-package solution that meets their business needs while also offering a competitive edge over others in the market. And the ripple effect doesn’t stop there—investors also stand to benefit as the adoption of token payments grows. More retailers using the system means more consumers adopting the token, which directly drives up its value. This creates a strong, sustainable ecosystem where the retailer, the consumer, and the investor all win.</p>
            <p>By providing a seamless, compliant, and rewarding payment system, we not only help cannabis retailers run their businesses more efficiently but also create a thriving market for investors to profit from as token adoption grows rapidly. For retailers, it’s a no-brainer; for investors, it’s an opportunity to be a part of something that’s poised for exponential growth.</p>

        <span id="toggleText3" style="font-size: 18px;"> This not only gives them peace of mind but also...</span><a class="modern-link toggleButton3"  onclick="toggleText3()" id="toggleBtn-investor-gain-3">Show More</a>

            <br>
           <h3 style="font-weight: bold; color: #5737c4;">The Company Prioritises Early Investors</h3>
           <br>
           <p>From the company's standpoint, Tangi's payment solution is a revolutionary leap forward in how the cannabis industry processes payments. At the core of our business strategy lies the Tangi token, a unique and highly profitable payment option that is set to disrupt the industry. By integrating the token into the payment solution, we not only provide a compliant, legal, and transparent service to cannabis retailers but also generate higher profit margins for ourselves.</p>
           <p>Unlike traditional payment processors, we retain the entire 3% transaction fee when consumers pay with the token. In contrast, traditional card payments typically involve sharing fees with other parties, leaving us with only a fraction of the revenue. Even though the token payment is cheaper for retailers and provides more rewards to consumers, the overall profitability for us as a company increases significantly due to the full retention of fees. This means more revenue per transaction, giving us greater control over our business growth.</p>
           <p>One of the biggest advantages of this token-based model is that it allows us to operate independently of the banking networks and traditional payment rails, something that is essential in the cannabis industry, where most payment solutions are hindered by banking regulations. By disengaging from the traditional banking systems, we avoid the risks and restrictions that come with reliance on banking partners and card networks, giving us unparalleled freedom and flexibility in how we process payments. This is a critical advantage that we leverage to scale our business rapidly, without having to worry about potential shutdowns or regulatory hurdles.</p>
           <p>Additionally, our compliance with regulatory standards and transparent processes gives us the ability to scale without limitations. By offering the cannabis industry a solution that works within the law, we address a crucial pain point—allowing both retailers and consumers to operate digitally and legally, as opposed to relying on the outdated and risky cash-based transactions or other non-compliant workarounds.</p>
           <p>The widespread adoption of the token is central to our growth strategy. Every transaction conducted through our payment platform increases the demand for the token, which in turn drives up its value.</p>
           <div class="hidden-content-investor-gain" id="hiddenContent-investor-gain-4">
           <p> This creates a self-sustaining ecosystem, where consumers, retailers, and investors alike benefit from the token’s success.</p>
           <p>In essence, our strategy isn’t just about revolutionizing payments in the cannabis industry—it’s about creating an ecosystem where we control every aspect of the transaction process. With no dependence on third-party banks or card networks, we unlock an entirely new level of scalability and profitability for the business. The token is the key to all of this, ensuring that as the token gains adoption, we control the platform that facilitates every payment. As we continue to expand our reach and bring more retailers and consumers into the fold, the value of the token will only continue to increase, ultimately benefiting the company, the investors, and everyone involved.</p>
           <p>This strategy doesn’t just benefit the company—it plays directly into the hands of our investors. By leveraging the token, we are not only improving our profit margins but also creating a self-sustaining ecosystem. As the company profits from higher transaction fees, investors stand to gain from the appreciating value of the token as demand increases. The cheaper fees for retailers and the rewards for consumers create a more attractive payment option, which leads to increased adoption of the token. As more businesses and consumers use the token, its value rises, ultimately benefiting investors who hold tokens. This interconnected growth ensures that as the company scales, the retailer’s adoption of our solution, the consumer’s increasing use of the token, and the company’s growing revenue all lead to one thing—the increased value of the token, making it a highly profitable investment. In this model, everyone wins, but the investor stands at the core of this success, benefiting from the long-term value and sustained growth driven by the actions of the retailer, the consumer, and the company itself.</p>
